# Fake-streaming-status-for-Discord
This is originally coded by DayZoonHD, I just fixed it.
------------------------------------------------------
add these two pakages to "pakage.json" : "discord.js" and "Discord"
when in glitch.com enter this command in the terminal "npm install discord.js@11.5.1" it should show an install progress.
and it should work if you any problems don't worry just pm me on discord, mart#3643

ps : this is selfbotting that means it's against the Discord tos don't do this if you don't wanna risk an ban.
but you should be fine.
